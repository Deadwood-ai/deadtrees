**Pilot Closure Guideline** 

Use this checklist to document, evaluate, and communicate the outcomes of your pilot. This document is structured in three chapters: 

1\. **Report your progress** – *internal document* that reflects on your pilot’s process,  changes, and lessons learned. 

2\. **Deliverable Checklist** – *public outputs* that present your final results and next steps 3\. **The Template for the Roadmap** – Guidelines to create the main report 

1\. Progress report and Feedback 

 This report is essential for the Pilot Coordination Office. In the final road map, we expect  a cohesive storyline, but for process evaluation we need to understand key aspects of  your progress. If your final product perfectly aligns with the proposal you just have to  focus on the resolution. This document is **internal** and will **not be shared publicly**.  (max. 2 Pages) 

 **Progress report** 

 **Summary of your progress:** Summarize what you have actually achieved  relative to your initial goals. 

 **Scope changes:** Has this changed the scope of your pilot program as initially  described in the proposal? 

 **Adaptations:** Why have you changed the plan? Briefly explain the main reasons  for any deviations (e.g., new findings, constraints, or external factors). 

 **Current state:** Write your current storyline based on the real progress and  experience to date, not on planned activities. 

 **Resolution**: Explain what has actually changed through your pilot. What was  accomplished, developed, or demonstrated. 

 **Include Learnings and Challenges:** Document important lessons learned,  including negative results or difficulties encountered. These insights are valuable  for improving future pilots and fostering shared learning across the community.  
2\. Checklist for the deliverables: 

![][image1]**Roadmap** 

 Use the template. (See Below Chapter 3\) 

 Document your pilot experience, prepare a forward-looking roadmap  This is the most important deliverable. 

![][image2]**Living Handbook**. Update or create your entry. 

 This can be a shorter version of your storyline with links and explanations of the pilot.  Keep the structure similar to your roadmap for consistency. 

 Guideline 

 Examples 

![][image3]Update Your **Git Repository** 

 Repository link 

 **Mandatory items:** 

• README file (Example) 

• YAML header (Example) 

 **Favorable additions:** 

• Code publication 

• Tutorials or usage examples 

![][image4]**Upload** your Roadmap and all necessary items on Zulip.  
***3\. Template Roadmap NFDI4Earth Pilots***  

***1st Pilot Cohort April 2022 – March 2023*** 

The roadmap should document the progress and results of your NFDI4Earth pilot projects. It serves as project report and outlook to assess the potential of your outcomes. It should demonstrate the functionalities of your solution and show how it supports a broader community in their research data management workflows. 

***Project closure process:*** 

1\) Write your roadmap following this template (starting page 3), think about publication of further deliverables 

2\) Create a Zenodo account and get familiar with upload details 

3\) Contact Veronika and send roadmap for quick check, discuss last questions/details on Zenodo publication 

4\) Publication on Zenodo, once published notify Veronika  

**Formal Criteria Roadmap:** 

 Minimum 4 pages, font size 11 (can be longer depending on your needs, figures etc.)  Sub-questions don’t have to be answered in the order of the bullet points, they are a reference which contents are expected in which part of the report.  

 Not all parts have to be of equal length (e.g., introduction might be shorter)  *Contributors:* in the table on the cover page, we ask you to list the contributors to the pilot. If several people were involved, please indicate their contributions based on the CRediT Contributor Roles Taxonomy (https://credit.niso.org/). One person can contribute in several roles and one role can have several contributors. In the latter case use terms like *lead* or *equal* to specify. 

 During the Zenodo publication process use the reserve DOI option. You can then add the generated DOI to the roadmap cover page, save as pdf and upload the final roadmap to your Zenodo record.  
**Zenodo Publication** 

To close your project, we ask you to publish this roadmap and all previously unpublished files, e.g., data, code, tutorials, related to the pilot on **Zenodo**. 

Please upload **both** the roadmap as pdf and any additional files within **one Zenodo record** with one DOI (select multiple files in the upload field).  

*Exceptions*: If you want to publish a Git Repository (i.e., a snapshot at the moment of project closure) you have to create a separate record and link it with the *related identifiers* option to the record of the roadmap. If your outcomes are published else-where please provide links in the roadmap and in the description field of the Zenodo record. 

*Please note:* Metadata of Zenodo record can be altered after publication, however the uploaded files cannot. 

Requested metadata for your Zenodo record in the order of appearance on the upload page: 

1\) **Files:** Upload your roadmap as pdf including reserved DOI and any additional previously unpublished files 

2\) **Communities:** Add the NFDI4Earth Community here. Please double check your entry with the curation policy: https://zenodo.org/communities/nfdi4earth/ 

3\) **Upload type:** Publication, Publication type: Report  

4\) **DOI:** Use the *Reserve DOI* option, add DOI to your roadmap and upload pdf file 5\) **Title:** same as roadmap title 

6\) **Authors:** list all contributors with names, affiliations and ORCID 

7\) **Description:** contains the abstract of the roadmap, if applicable add URL to developed solution or documentation/tutorials published outside Zenodo (in case of an online platform, existing software or alike) 

8\) **Keywords:** add *NFDI4Earth*, *NFDI4Earth Pilot* and any additional keywords related to your pilot (remark: Zenodo does not recognize comma separation, please double check if your keywords are separated properly) 

9\) **Additional notes:** Please insert the following statement on financial support from NFDI4Earth here: *This work has been funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) through the project NFDI4Earth (TA1 M1.1, DFG project no. 460036893, https://www.nfdi4earth.de/) within the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI, https://www.nfdi.de/).* 

10\) **Access right and license:** Open Access and a CC license (in case of mixed license content provide details in the *Additional notes* field below *Keywords*) 

11\) **Related/alternate identifiers:** In case you uploaded additional outcomes as separate Zenodo records, e.g., a Git repository please set the related identifiers links here in both records.

**Abstract** 

*We expect a short summary of the pilot project organized as follows (one sentence for each point): 1\. General introduction to scientific context, 2\. Concrete problem under scrutiny, 3\. Objective of the pilot, 4\. Outcomes (max. two sentences), 5\. Community impact of the pilot results, 6\. Perspective of the pilot and future directions (max. two sentences).*
