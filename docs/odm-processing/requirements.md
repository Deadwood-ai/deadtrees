# ODM Raw Drone Image Processing - Requirements Document

**Version:** 2.1  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Project:** DeadTrees Platform - OpenDroneMap Integration  
**Status:** ‚úÖ UPDATED - Processor-Centric Architecture

---

## üìã **OVERVIEW**

Backend integration of OpenDroneMap (ODM) for processing raw drone images into orthomosaics within the existing DeadTrees processing pipeline using a **processor-centric architecture** where all technical analysis and ortho table population occurs during processing, not upload.

### **System Boundary**
- **Frontend**: Enhanced upload interface supporting both GeoTIFF and ZIP files
- **Backend API**: Simplified upload endpoints focused on file storage only
- **Processing Server**: All technical analysis, ortho table creation, and standardization
- **Storage Server**: File storage and transfer via SSH during processing
- **Database**: Extended queue system and raw image metadata tracking

### **Unified Processing Flow (Processor-Centric)**
1. **Upload**: Users upload GeoTIFF or ZIP - files stored with minimal processing
   - **GeoTIFF**: Store in `archive/{dataset_id}_ortho.tif` - NO ortho entry creation
   - **ZIP**: Extract to `raw_images/{dataset_id}/` - create raw_images entry only
2. **Processing**: ALL technical analysis happens in processor
   - **GeoTIFF Path**: Process existing ortho ‚Üí create ortho entry ‚Üí standardize ‚Üí pipeline
   - **ZIP Path**: ODM processing ‚Üí generate ortho ‚Üí create ortho entry ‚Üí standardize ‚Üí pipeline
3. **Convergence**: Both paths identical after ortho entry creation and standardization

## üóÑÔ∏è **DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGES**

### **Separate v2_raw_images Table - Clean Architecture**
Keep v2_datasets focused on final processed data, create separate table for raw input material:

```sql
-- New table for raw drone image metadata
CREATE TABLE "public"."v2_raw_images" (
    "dataset_id" bigint NOT NULL REFERENCES "public"."v2_datasets"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    "raw_image_count" integer NOT NULL,
    "raw_image_size_mb" integer NOT NULL,
    "raw_images_path" text NOT NULL, -- Contains both images and RTK files
    "camera_metadata" jsonb,
    "has_rtk_data" boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    "rtk_precision_cm" numeric(4,2),
    "rtk_quality_indicator" integer,
    "rtk_file_count" integer DEFAULT 0,
    "version" integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    "created_at" timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- Add index and primary key
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX v2_raw_images_pkey ON public.v2_raw_images USING btree (dataset_id);
ALTER TABLE "public"."v2_raw_images" ADD CONSTRAINT "v2_raw_images_pkey" PRIMARY KEY using index "v2_raw_images_pkey";
```

### **Status Table Extensions - Following Existing Patterns**
Extend existing v2_statuses table with ODM processing flags:

```sql
-- Add ODM processing to status enum (follows existing pattern)
ALTER TYPE "public"."v2_status" ADD VALUE 'odm_processing';

-- Add ODM completion flag (follows existing is_*_done pattern)
ALTER TABLE "public"."v2_statuses" ADD COLUMN "is_odm_done" boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false;
```

### **Ortho Table Population Strategy**
**Key Change**: Ortho entries created ONLY during processing, never during upload:

- **GeoTIFF uploads**: File stored in archive/, ortho entry created during geotiff processing task
- **ZIP uploads**: Files extracted to raw_images/, ortho entry created after ODM generates orthomosaic
- **Unified processing**: Both paths use identical ortho creation logic in processor

### **Frontend EXIF Extraction Strategy**
- Extract acquisition date **in frontend** during ZIP selection/preview
- Populate v2_datasets.aquisition_* fields directly via upload API
- Store comprehensive camera metadata in v2_raw_images.camera_metadata
- **Benefits**: Immediate validation, lighter server load, better UX, no technical analysis during upload

### **Task Execution Requirements**
**Critical**: Both upload types MUST include `geotiff` processing task:
- **GeoTIFF uploads**: Queue `['geotiff', 'cog', 'thumbnail', 'metadata']`
- **ZIP uploads**: Queue `['odm_processing', 'geotiff', 'cog', 'thumbnail', 'metadata']`
- **Processor ensures**: GeoTIFF processing always creates ortho entry before other tasks
