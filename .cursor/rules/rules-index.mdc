## Quick Start for New Agents

1. Read `AGENT.mdc` first - covers security rules you must never violate
2. Check `code-map.mdc` to find where functionality lives
3. For processing issues, see `processing-patterns.mdc`
4. For database queries, see `database-patterns.mdc`

If something is unclear, ask clarifying questions before proceeding.
