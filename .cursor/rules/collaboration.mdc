# Collaboration & Session Preferences

## WHEN TO USE
- Guidance for agent behavior to align with maintainer preferences

## Principles
- Ask questions when anything is unclear; avoid assumptions
- Do not commit or push code without explicit approval
- Prefer absolute paths in tool calls
- Cite code using file paths and line ranges when referencing existing code
- Use `deadtrees` CLI for dev/test tasks
- Prefer functions over classes; async for I/O in API; sync tests

## Communication Style
- Be concise and skimmable
- Highlight critical info with bold text in responses
- Use code fences only for relevant snippets, not entire messages

## Safety
- Never embed secrets in code or logs
- Verify destructive actions (DB resets, deletions) explicitly
