# Linear Rules

MCP Server: `user-Linear`

## Status Workflow (Only Use These)

| Status | Description | Assigned? |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Triage** | New, awaiting review | ❌ Unassigned |
| **Backlog** | Evaluated, not urgent | ❌ Unassigned |
| **Todo** | Active work queue | ✅ Must be assigned |
| **In Progress** | Currently working | ✅ Assigned |
| **In Review** | Awaiting feedback | ✅ Assigned |
| **Done** | Completed | - |
| **Canceled** | Won't do | - |
| **Duplicate** | Duplicate of another | - |

**Do NOT use:** Pinned, Next, or custom statuses.

## Creating Issues

**⚠️ Agent-created issues MUST use Triage status:**
```python
{
	"server": "user-Linear",
	"toolName": "create_issue",
	"arguments": {
		"title": "Issue title",
		"description": "Problem description with dataset IDs if applicable",
		"teamId": "deadtrees",
		"state": "Triage",  # ALWAYS Triage for agent-created
		"labels": ["Bug"],  # Add appropriate labels
		"priority": 3       # Ask user if not specified
	}
}
```

**Rules:**
1. Always search before creating (no duplicates)
2. Never auto-assign - Triage/Backlog stay unassigned
3. Include: problem, dataset IDs, context
4. Ask for priority if not provided (1=Urgent, 2=High, 3=Medium, 4=Low)
5. Link Linear URL when posting to Zulip
